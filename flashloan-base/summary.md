# Manual Flash Loan on Base

## üìç Overview

This prototype has a basic flashloan which borrows and returns 1000 usdc without any arbitrage logic. It was the first working flash loan
I ever executed, and it was the first big milestone in my development journey.  This folder also includes a scanner that attempts to find price 
discrepancies between two fixed tier base WETH/USDC liquidty pools on sushiswap and uniswap. This scanner tried to incorporate the use of a 
'borrowing advantage' variable. A profit margin which I thought existed in theory, but later realized the mathematical logic was incorrect.
