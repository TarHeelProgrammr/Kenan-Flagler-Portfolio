0xf70F03064859d4dc66D4F417b0A18d179614D6C5    3/20/2025   We updated the scanner to scan by block, but we think there might be a delay in price from when the scanner reads it and when the flashloan trys and executes.  Scanner is only catching like every other ther block.

Borrowing advantage doesn't work and too little spread between uniswap and sushsiswap for liquidty
