This is my SQL final project for the first part of Global career Accelator Coding for Data Anayaltics Program.

We didn't have the option to download the datasets used for this project. 

We used SQLpad online when we ran our code, and once we got the desired output we would type our code into a google doc. 

I uploaded a PDF of that same google doc, and also included screenshots that show snippets of the output.
