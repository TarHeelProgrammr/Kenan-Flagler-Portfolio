# Triangular Arbitrage Prototype on Base

## üìç Overview

The project includes three different scanners, each designed to detect three-legged triangular arbitrage oppurtunities. 
This project also includes a triangular arbitrage flashloan smart contract which did succesfully deploy, but did not work properly because the python scanner
wasn't working properly. 

I also beleive I deleted the deployment script, but we do have a deployed smart contract address in the documentation

## üîß Stack

- Solidity + Hardhat  
- Python (for off-chain analytics)  
- Node.js
