# Kenan-Flagler-Portfolio
This is my portfolio for my Kenan-Flagler Business school application. 

# Portfolio Projects â€“ Kenan-Flagler Application

This portfolio is intended to display my technical skills, as well as how a combination of AI
and conceptual finance and coding knowledge has increased my ability as an entreprenuer. 
I think it's important to provide snippets of my code because not only does it highlight
milestones in my journey as a software developer. But people don't just want to hear claims
they also want to see results.

I want to clarify for my personal endevaours (The manual flashloan and the dex arbitrage scanner) I did in fact use AI when developing that software. I woudn't consider myself to be lazy or cheating in the software development process. Becuase for me AI didn't keep my brain sendentary, by not having to learn all the coding languages in depth traditionally, but rather it weaponized me as a designer. Similair to a mathemetician using a calculator for simple multiplication, I believe that as long as you understand conceptually how something works, there is no problem in using technology to help you overcome certain nuances. However, that is not to say 'certain nuances' aren't worth learning at all. That's how China was able to make powerful AI's by optimizing their alogrithims, even though U.S companies thought they lacked GPU's.
