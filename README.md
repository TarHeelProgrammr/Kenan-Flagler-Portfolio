# Kenan-Flagler-Portfolio
This is my portfolio for my Kenan-Flagler Business school application. 

# Portfolio Projects â€“ Kenan-Flagler Application

This portfolio is intended to display my technical skills, as well as how a combination of AI, conceptual finance and 
coding knowledge has increased my ability as an entreprenuer. 

Projects 1-3 were my personal endeavours. While projects 4-5 were through the Global Career Accelerator Coding 
for Data Analytics. 

In each folder their is a file called summary.md please click on that for context of each
project.

I want to clarify for my personal endevaours (The manual flashloan and the dex arbitrage scanner) I did in fact use AI when developing that software. I woudn't consider myself to be lazy or cheating in the software development process. Becuase for me AI didn't keep my brain sendentary, by not having to learn all the coding languages in depth traditionally, but rather it weaponized me as a designer. Similair to a mathemetician using a calculator for simple multiplication, I believe that as long as you understand conceptually how something works, there is no problem in using technology to help you overcome certain nuances. However, that is not to say 'certain nuances' aren't worth learning at all.
