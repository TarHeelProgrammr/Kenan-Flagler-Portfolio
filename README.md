This is my portfolio for my Kenan-Flagler Business school application. 

# Portfolio Projects â€“ Kenan-Flagler Application

Welcome! This is a curated selection of backend, DeFi, and data projects that highlight both my technical and analytical growth. AI tools accelerated my development process, but every idea, architecture, and debugging loop was mine.

## ðŸš€ Projects

### 1. [Manual Flash Loan on Base](./flashloan-base/)
- Description: A working flash loan prototype on Base chain using Aave liquidity.

I want to clarify for my personal endevaours (The manual flashloan and the dex arbitrage scanner) I did in fact use AI when developing that software. I woudn't consider myself to be lazy or cheating in the software development process. Becuase for me AI didn't keep my brain sendentary, by not having to learn all the coding languages in depth traditionally, but rather it weaponized me as a designer. Similair to a mathemetician using a calculator for simple multiplication, I believe that as long as you understand conceptually how something works, there is no problem in using technology to help you overcome certain nuances.
