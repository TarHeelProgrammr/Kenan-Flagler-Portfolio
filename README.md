# Portfolio Projects â€“ Kenan-Flagler Application

This portfolio is intended to display my technical skills, as well as how a combination of AI, conceptual finance and 
coding knowledge has increased my ability as an entreprenuer. 

Projects 1-3 were my personal endeavours which I developed using AI.  While projects 4-5 were through the Global Career Accelerator Coding 
for Data Analytics program. 

In each folder their is a file called summary.md please click on that for context of each
